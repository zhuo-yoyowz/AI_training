## Exercise 2: POT Quantization with YOLOv5

_Goal_: Understand the POT funtionality. 

_Notebook_: [220-yolov5-accuracy-check-and-quantization](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/220-yolov5-accuracy-check-and-quantization)

_Action_: Run all cells and see the perfomance on your laptop.

### Task #2:

1. Run all the cells in the YOLOv5 notebook.
2. Upload an image of your own and run the inference andÂ compare the performance.
3. Share with us your screenshot and result using this Discussion thread, using Task #2 and your name in the header message.
