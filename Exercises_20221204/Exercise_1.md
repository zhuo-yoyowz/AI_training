## Exercise 1: Basic with OpenVINO

_Goal_: Understand how we can accelerate the prototyping and deployment process in AI, using OpenVINO, jupyter notebooks and a simple webcam. We will be focus on model precision.

_Notebook_: [404-style-transfer-webcam](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/404-style-transfer-webcam)

_Action_: Run all cells and see the perfomance on your laptop using your webcam.

### Task #1: 

1. Run the style transfer notebook and tell us how many FPS you have and what is your CPU or iGPU.
2. Share with us your screenshot and result using this Discussion thread, using Task # 1 and your name in the header message.
